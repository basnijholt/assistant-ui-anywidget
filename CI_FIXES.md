# CI Fixes Documentation

This document outlines the CI issues that were identified and resolved.

## Issues Fixed

### 1. TypeScript Error in Frontend Tests

**Issue**: `TS6133: 'React' is declared but its value is never read` in `frontend/src/VariableExplorer.test.tsx`

**Root Cause**: Unused React import in test file. React 17+ doesn't require React to be in scope for JSX in test files.

**Solution**: Removed the unused `import React from "react";` statement from line 5.

**Files Changed**:

- `frontend/src/VariableExplorer.test.tsx`

### 2. Python Test Coverage Below Threshold

**Issue**: Test coverage was 68.13%, below the required 70% threshold.

**Root Cause**: Missing tests for git-native tools functionality in `kernel_tools.py` which reduced overall coverage.

**Solution**: Added comprehensive test suite for git-native tools with 17 test cases covering:

- `ListFilesTool` functionality
- `GitGrepTool` search capabilities
- `GitFindTool` file finding
- Error handling and edge cases
- Type annotations for mypy compliance

**Files Changed**:

- `tests/test_git_native_tools.py` (new file)

## Results

### Before Fixes

- ❌ TypeScript compilation failed
- ❌ Python coverage: 68.13% (below 70% threshold)
- ❌ CI pipeline failing

### After Fixes

- ✅ TypeScript compilation successful
- ✅ Python coverage: 70.64% (above 70% threshold)
- ✅ All 159 Python tests passing
- ✅ All 23 frontend tests passing
- ✅ CI pipeline passing

## Test Coverage Improvement

The new test file `tests/test_git_native_tools.py` added comprehensive coverage for:

```python
# Git-native tools tested
- ListFilesTool (list_files)
- GitGrepTool (git_grep)
- GitFindTool (git_find)

# Test scenarios covered
- Basic functionality
- Error handling
- Edge cases (non-git repos, no matches, etc.)
- File pattern matching
- Case sensitivity options
- Mock subprocess interactions
```

This improved `kernel_tools.py` coverage from 38% to 58%, contributing to the overall project coverage increase from 68.13% to 70.64%.
